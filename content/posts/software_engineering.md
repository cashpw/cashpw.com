## Titles {#titles}

As I see them, the titles break down by direct, individual-level, execution (i.e. coding) and leadership:

-   Individual contributor: Little to no leadership, lots of execution
-   Senior software engineer: A middle-ground with some mix of leadership and execution depending on where the individual wants their career to go
-   Staff engineer: Lots of leadership, little to no execution


## Expand {#expand}

-   Senior software engineer
