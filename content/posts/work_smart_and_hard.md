'Work smart, not hard' is [Lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True]({{< relref "lowercase_a_accurate_without_being_capital_t_true.md" >}}). Yes, one could achieve the same with less effort by being smart about when, where, how, etc, they applied that effort. But that's not how it's often done in practice. I've more often seen, with others and myself, this phrase used as if it meant "Working smart means I don't have to work hard". That's the inaccuracy. You'll still have to work hard. Maybe not as hard, or maybe for not as long, but still: you'll work hard.

I recommend working both smart **and** hard. Be intelligent about how you apply your effort but remember that you still need to put in effort.
