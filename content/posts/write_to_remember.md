Write things down, and make them discoverable, so you can refer back to them later and refresh your memory. It's not about remembering _everything_ you ever encounter. As an example: I like to go back through my notes on books I've read (reading quotes and reflections) as the topic re-emerges in my life, or just for fun.

Additionally, the act of writing them down helps embed them in your memory even if you never come back to your writing.
