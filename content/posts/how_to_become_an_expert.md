You get pretty good at something by a mixture of study and practice. You get to be an expert by building up an extensive library of [explicit]({{< relref "explicit_knowledge.md" >}}) and [tacit]({{< relref "tacit_knowledge.md" >}}) knowledge. Traditionally an expert is made through study (for the explicit) and experience (for the tacit). They do the relevant thing for a _long_ time and thereby gaining a library of situations and experience which the expert draws on, consciously and unconsciously, to make [decisions]({{< relref "naturalistic_decision_making.md" >}}).

What's the most effective way to acquire explicit and tacit knowledge? The answer depends on the subject matter. Use [Deliberate practice]({{< relref "deliberate_practice.md" >}}) for subjects with a "long history of well-established pedagogy" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Chin 2020</a>) (for example: math, music, and chess). Use [Purposeful practice]({{< relref "purposeful_practice.md" >}}) for other subjects (for example: business, sales, sport, art, singing, writing, poetry, etc).

Expertise, and tacit knowledge by extension, boils down to pattern matching, specifically [Recognition-primed decision]({{< relref "recognition_primed_decision_making_model.md" >}}) making via a mental library of [Frames]({{< relref "framing.md" >}}). [Improve]({{< relref "recognition_primed_decision_making_model.md#how-to-improve-at-id-4a42aa6f-413f-4144-86df-5c0f0b174777-recognition-primed-decision-making" >}}) by working through simulations ([Prefer simulations that already exist]({{< relref "applied_cognitive_task_analysis.md#choosing-good-simulations" >}})) or real-world experience (e.g. apprenticeship / on-the-job experience). Use [Applied cognitive task analysis]({{< relref "applied_cognitive_task_analysis.md" >}}) to extract expertise from specific experts.
