You become an expert by building up [explicit]({{< relref "explicit_knowledge.md" >}}) and [tacit]({{< relref "tacit_knowledge.md" >}}) knowledge; because [expertise is pattern matching]({{< relref "recognition_primed_decision_making_model.md" >}}) based on known [Frames]({{< relref "data_frame_model.md#frame--data-frame-model" >}}).

Traditionally an expert is made through study (for the explicit) and experience (for the tacit). They do the relevant thing for a _long_ time and thereby gaining a library they can draw on, consciously and unconsciously, to make decisions. However, we can speed up the process by [working smart]({{< relref "work_smart_and_hard.md" >}}).

What's the most effective way to acquire explicit and tacit knowledge? The answer depends on the subject matter:

-   Use [Deliberate practice]({{< relref "deliberate_practice.md" >}}) for subjects with a "long history of well-established pedagogy" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Chin 2020</a>) (for example: math, music, and chess)
-   Use [Purposeful practice]({{< relref "purposeful_practice.md" >}}) for other subjects (for example: business, sales, sport, art, singing, writing, poetry, etc).
