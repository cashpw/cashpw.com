      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It&amp;rsquo;s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib] learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It&amp;rsquo;s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Irulan Corrino, (&lt;a href=&#34;#citeproc_bib_item_1&#34;&gt;Herbert 1999&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my Favorites. A Lesson to teach my children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
