Create a Task diagram


Ask the subject matter expert to decompose the task in to steps, or subtasks, into 3-6

&ldquo;The interviewer limits the SME to between three and six steps, to ensure that time is not wasted delving into minute detail during the surface-level interview.&rdquo; (Militello and Hutton 1998)

<a href=#simulation-interview class=heading-anchor>#</a></h3><blockquote><p>The simulation interview allows the interviewer to better understand the SME&rsquo;s cognitive processes within the context of an incident. [&mldr;]</p><p>The simulation interview is based on presentation of a challenging scenario to the SME. The authors recommend that the interviewer retrieves a scenario that already exists for use in this interview. Often, simulations and scenarios exist for training purposes. It may be necessary to adapt or modify the scenario to conform to practical constraints such as time limitations. Developing a new simulation specifically for use in the interview is not a trivial task and is likely to require an upfront CTA in order to gather the foundational information needed to present a challenging situation. The simulation can be in the form of a paper-and-pencil exercise, perhaps using maps or other diagrams. In some settings it may be possible to use video or computer-supported simulations. Surprisingly, in the authors&rsquo; experience, the fidelity of the simulation is not an important issue. The key is that the simulation presents a challenging scenario.</p><p>After exposure to the simulation, the SME is asked to identify major events, including judgements and decisions, with a question such as, `As you experience this simulation, imagine you are the (job you are investigating) in the incident. Afterwards, I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you would think and act in this situation&rsquo;. Each event is probed for situation assessment, actions, critical cues, and potential errors surrounding that event (figure 3).</p><p>Information elicited is recorded in the simulation interview table (table 2). Using the same simulation for interviews with multiple SMEs can provide insight into situations in which more than one action would be acceptable, and alternative assessments of the same situation are plausible. This technique can be used to highlight differing SME perspectives, which is important information for developing training and system design recommendations. The technique can also be used to contrast expert and novice perspectives by conducting interviews with people of differing levels of expertise using the same simulation.</p><p>(<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_2>Militello and Hutton 1998</a>)</p></blockquote><h4 id=simulation-interview-probes>Simulation interview probes
