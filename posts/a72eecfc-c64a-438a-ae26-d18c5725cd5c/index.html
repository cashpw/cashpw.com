Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique [Pedagogy] that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect [Spacing effect]. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.
[&mldr;]
The basis for spaced repetition research was laid by Hermann Ebbinghaus, who suggested that information loss over time follows a forgetting curve [Forgetting curve], but that forgetting could be reset with repetition based on active recall.

Why is spaced repetition so dreadfully unpopular, even among the people who try it once?⁠</p><p>Because it does work. Sort of. Cramming is a trade-off: you trade a strong memory now for weak memory later. (Very weak⁠⁠.) And tests are usually of all the new material, with occasional old questions, so this strategy pays off!
