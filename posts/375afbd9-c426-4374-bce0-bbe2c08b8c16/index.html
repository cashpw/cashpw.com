Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had told this to me.
All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But it&rsquo;s like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you&rsquo;re making stuff, what you&rsquo;re making isn&rsquo;t so good. It&rsquo;s not that great. It&rsquo;s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it&rsquo;s not that good.

It&rsquo;s easier to recognize &ldquo;good&rdquo; work than it is to produce it.</p><blockquote><p>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had told this to me.</p><p>All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But it&rsquo;s like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you&rsquo;re making stuff, what you&rsquo;re making isn&rsquo;t so good. It&rsquo;s not that great. It&rsquo;s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it&rsquo;s not that good.</p><p>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you&rsquo;re making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They quit.</p><p>Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn&rsquo;t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that.</p><p>And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you&rsquo;re going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you&rsquo;re going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you&rsquo;re making will be as good as your ambitions.</p><p>I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met. It takes awhile. It&rsquo;s gonna take you a while. It&rsquo;s normal to take a while. You just have to fight your way through that.</p><p>(<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_1>Glass 2009</a>)</p></blockquote><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography
