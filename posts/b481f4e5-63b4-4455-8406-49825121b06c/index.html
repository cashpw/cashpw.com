Summary
#

&ldquo;Expertise&rdquo; is an Emergent property of pattern matching.
Being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at:

recognizing situations
knowing how to respond to those situations

This is Recognition-primed decision making.
Simple, right?

Thoughts
#

The idea rings true to me when I think about how chess masters describe thinking about the game in the moment. I recall them mentioning pattern matching explicitly; though I&rsquo;ve since lost the reference.

<a href=#notes class=heading-anchor>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>[&mldr;] the notion that &rsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching&rsquo; [&mldr;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I&rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.</p><p>The first idea is the &lsquo;recognition-primed decision making&rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses. I&rsquo;ve written extensively about the model on this blog, so I&rsquo;m not going to repeat myself (read <a href=https://commoncog.com/putting-mental-models-to-practice/>this instead</a>) but the core of it is simply that expertise is an <a href=https://commoncog.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-human-learning-and-memory-retention/#-recognition-the-basis-of-expertise>implicit memory operation</a>: you recognise a situation in a developing environment and then unspool that recognition into a set of cues, a list of plausible goals, and handful of expectancies, and a series of trained actions. If the situation is novel, you construct variants of intended actions on the fly and simulate these scenarios in a loop, picking the first workable solution in your mind.</p><p>This model of expert decision-making is useful because it gives us a usable model of expertise — far better than the ones found in the deliberate practice literature. For example, one conclusion from this model is that <strong>if you want to become better at something, you should look for ways to expand the set of recognisable prototypes in your head</strong>.</p><p>The second idea is simply that expertise rests on <em>technê</em>, or <a href=/posts/d636dfa7-428d-457c-8db6-15fa61e03bef/>Tacit knowledge</a> &mdash; the sort of knowledge that is impossible to communicate, that must be constructed from practice. I&rsquo;ve written about this idea numerous times over the past two years: first in my <a href=https://commoncog.com/the-mental-model-fallacy/>original criticism</a> of mental model writing, then in my reflection on Seymour Papert&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s <a href=https://commoncog.com/you-cant-teach-what-they-arent-ready-to-know/>work</a>. I covered it again in <a href=https://commoncog.com/the-mental-model-faq/>The Mental Model FAQ</a> and <a href=https://commoncog.com/the-dangers-of-treating-ideas-from-finance-as-generalised-self-help/>The Dangers of Treating Ideas from Finance as Generalised Self Help</a>. I&rsquo;ve mentioned it here and there throughout Commonplace&rsquo;s history; indeed, my reliance on <em>technê</em> is one of the big pieces of idea scaffolding for this blog.</p><p>[emphasis mine]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[&mldr;] perhaps the art of practice is simply whatever is the most effective method of expanding one&rsquo;s collection of recognisable prototypes (and of course: the actions to take in response to those recognisable prototypes).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What about creativity, for instance? Klein covers this in his research; in Sources of Power he discusses how expert minds use pattern-recognition to identify &rsquo;leverage points&rsquo; — points in which one could do something radically different — in order to come up with creative solutions within the constraints of some domain. I&rsquo;ve dug a little into the research and I think the take is plausible, but I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced. Surely the mechanism of creativity is different from the prototype-based recognition that drives most of expertise? The short answer to that seems to be &lsquo;yes, creativity relies on connections between different ideas and this is independent of expertise&rsquo; but also &lsquo;identifying the right leverage points is still a recognition/expertise thing&rsquo;. The two seem highly intertwined in the sorts of fields that Klein studies; my remaining scepticism is that I do not know if this is true in &lsquo;pure&rsquo; creative domains like art and design and fiction writing.</p></blockquote><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography
